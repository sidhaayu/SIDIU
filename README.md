This repository contains HTML and CSS files demonstrating basic web development concepts such as semantic HTML tags and CSS styling. Below is a brief overview of the files and their contents:

Files:
index.html: This file is the main HTML file that serves as the entry point to the website. It contains a basic structure with headings, paragraphs, lists, and other essential HTML elements.

styles.css: The CSS file that styles the HTML elements defined in index.html. It includes styling for backgrounds, hover effects, and class-based styling.

HTML Tags Used:
Headings (h1-h6): Used for defining headings and subheadings to structure the content.
Paragraphs (p): Used to create paragraphs of text.
Emphasis (em): Used to emphasize text.
Strong (strong): Used to indicate stronger emphasis.
Lists (ul, ol, li): Used to create unordered and ordered lists.
Line Breaks (br): Used for manual line breaks within text.
CSS Elements Used:
Class Selectors: Used to apply specific styles to elements with assigned classes.
Background Color: Sets background colors for elements.
Hover Effects: Adds styles that are triggered when the mouse hovers over an element.
How to Use:
To use these files, simply download or clone the repository to your local machine. You can then open the index.html file in a web browser to view the webpage. Feel free to modify the HTML and CSS files to experiment with different styles and layouts.

Example:
Here's a snippet from index.html demonstrating the use of some HTML tags and CSS classes:

html
Copy code
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>My Website</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph with <em>emphasized</em> text.</p>
    <p>This is another paragraph with <strong>strong emphasis</strong>.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Item 1</li>
        <li>Item 2</li>
        <li>Item 3</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="box">This is a box with a background color.</div>
</body>
</html>
And corresponding styles in styles.css:

css
Copy code
.box {
    background-color: #f0f0f0;
    padding: 10px;
}

.box:hover {
    background-color: #ccc;
    fontsize:2.01rem
}
